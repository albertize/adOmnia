# Release Process

adOmnia releases are driven by Git tags and GitHub Actions.

## Unreleased

## v0.9.48 release notes: a cleaner gO rail and Project refresh controls

See [the full v0.9.48 notes](releases/v0.9.48.md): Go Studio's Project view
gets context-sensitive IntelliJ-style code actions, explicit Reload from Disk
and Refresh Folder / Project controls that protect dirty buffers. The compact
left rail now uses the transparent cyan gO mark, the README shows the current
Go Studio workspace, and the Brick Workshop skin has been removed completely.

## v0.9.42 release notes: Concurrency View, race comparison and an IDE-grade editor

See [the full v0.9.42 notes](releases/v0.9.42.md): the Concurrency View
completes the goroutine debugger (filters, stack grouping, relations, new
diagnostics, evidence badges, timeline, snapshot export), races are compared
across runs, and Go Studio gains editor core features, hierarchies, code
generation, vulnerability diagnostics, project tree decorations, go.work
management and Clone Repository.

## v0.9.41 release notes: a concurrency-first debugger

See [the full v0.9.41 notes](releases/v0.9.41.md): the Debug tool window is
rebuilt around goroutines, with states, blocked-on expressions, a
Concurrency view that flags deadlocks, blocked channels, mutex contention,
leaks and data races, navigable race detector reports, inline values while
paused and F6/F10/F5 debug keys.

## v0.9.40 release notes: a maximised editor, compose, key encryption and a new look

See [the full v0.9.40 notes](releases/v0.9.40.md): Maximize Editor and
fully closable panes, docker compose from the gutter, Send to API
Workspace, `.pem` keys opened and encrypted in Power Tools (standard
PKCS#8, verified with OpenSSL), and recent projects in the toolbar. Menus
and confirmation dialogs are redesigned, Jenkinsfiles and keys get their
own icons, the a0 launcher stays out of the way, and gopls runs lighter.

## v0.9.39 release notes: Go Studio runs Makefiles and Dockerfiles

See [the full v0.9.39 notes](releases/v0.9.39.md): the gutter ▶ runs
Makefile targets and builds or runs Dockerfiles with the real `make` and
`docker`. Stop really stops the container, and secret build args never
reach the command line. Every file type is now highlighted. Developer
Context turns the project's routes, services, datasources, contracts,
tables and topics into palette actions, and the Hub introduces the aO → gO
ecosystem.

## v0.9.38 release notes: Go Studio Fix with AI and real file icons

See [the full v0.9.38 notes](releases/v0.9.38.md): errors and warnings can
be fixed with the AI provider configured in adOmnia, always through a
reviewed preview, and every file list shows real technology icons.

## v0.9.37 release notes: Go Studio terminal, tests, debugger and GoLand parity

See [the full v0.9.37 notes](releases/v0.9.37.md): Go Studio adds a real
terminal, a structured test runner with coverage, the Delve debugger,
gopls refactoring and navigation, Git in the editor linked to Git Studio,
Project Services, separate project windows and a JetBrains-style chrome.

## v0.9.36 release notes: Go Studio becomes a real Go IDE

See [the full v0.9.36 notes](releases/v0.9.36.md): Go Studio now opens, edits,
understands, lints, runs and tests real Go projects. It adds gopls completion,
navigation, previewed rename and code actions; golangci-lint or staticcheck
findings; gutter ▶ actions for `func main` and tests; split editor, pinned
tabs and a symbolic breadcrumb; and a full GoLand-style menu bar. Debugger,
terminal and test runner tree come in later phases.

## v0.9.35 release notes: Go Studio foundation

See [the full v0.9.35 notes](releases/v0.9.35.md): adOmnia gains the
local-first Go Studio architecture, safe project sessions, a compact `gO`
entry in the existing rail and the first integrated desktop shell. Execution,
editing, gopls, terminal and debugger controls remain intentionally absent
until their gated implementation phases are complete.

## v0.9.34 release notes: a0 knows the product and builds mocks

See [the full v0.9.34 notes](releases/v0.9.34.md): a0 gains a real product
capability map, can generate local Mock Server endpoints and open panels from
chat, and replies in the user's language with bounded conversation context.

The release also lands the leaner startup and the extraction of a0: Bug Hunt
into a separate local project. The fresh Hub's static JavaScript graph falls
from 823,684 to 572,407 uncompressed bytes; closed editors, the command
palette, import parsers and the unconfigured AI companion are deferred, with a
CI startup budget to keep them out of the entry graph. Game source, tests and
artwork are preserved outside adOmnia, and no workspace or settings migration
is required.

## v0.9.33 release notes: a0 can act on the workspace

See [the full v0.9.33 notes](releases/v0.9.33.md): explicit Agent actions,
validated root request creation, a deterministic greeting-API command and a
live DeepSeek verification of the complete structured-action response.

## v0.9.32 release notes: smarter AI setup and native DeepSeek

See [the full v0.9.32 notes](releases/v0.9.32.md): native DeepSeek support,
automatic provider credential discovery, a generic English a0 conversation and
a responsive master-detail AI Engine settings experience.

## v0.9.31 release notes: a living Hub, deliberate play, and focused workspaces

See [the full v0.9.31 notes](releases/v0.9.31.md): a full-body reactive a0
mascot in the Hub, verified-AI chat entry, Bug Hunt launched only by an explicit
request to a0, the new Terminal Green appearance, consolidated customization
settings and a connection-first Broker Studio.

## v0.9.21 release notes: Developer Desk route and visual refresh

See [the full v0.9.21 notes](releases/v0.9.21.md): vertical opening, physical modules, code packets, new enemy art and focus handling.

## v0.9.20 release notes: connected platforming and slide-jumps

See [the full v0.9.20 notes](releases/v0.9.20.md): tuned movement, slide-jump momentum, controllable rebounds, connected desk routes and the larger active Brute finale.

## v0.9.19 release notes: a developer-world campaign and controllable boss gravity

See [the full v0.9.19 notes](releases/v0.9.19.md): three distinct worlds, flying
enemies and specialized attacks, tutorial rule overrides, and a three-phase
Monolith with timed gravity, a safe zone and destructible modules.

## v0.9.18 release notes: a0 has a personality, a bigger Localhost, and three lives

See [the full v0.9.18 notes](releases/v0.9.18.md): reactive expressions, landing
and ledge poses, checkpoint celebrations and contextual quips; Localhost grown by
roughly 50% with seven extra enemies; and three hearts that now cover the entire
campaign, with Game Over at zero. Previous records stay in their original storage
keys, while audio and accessibility settings migrate to the new campaign profile.

## v0.9.17 release notes: a beatable final boss, built platforms, and a dependency sweep

See [the full v0.9.17 notes](releases/v0.9.17.md): the arena slab that made
the Legacy Monolith unbeatable is fixed and guarded by a test, Bug Hunt
platforms become real chassis instead of rectangles, the start menu explains
itself, and every direct dependency moves to its current release.

## v0.9.16 release notes: parallel WebSocket sends, and a boss that rewrites the rules

See [the full v0.9.16 notes](releases/v0.9.16.md): concurrent WebSocket bursts
with `---` and `{{$i}}`, a debug gun and reactive enemies in Bug Hunt, a Legacy
Monolith that throws SOAP envelopes and rewrites one rule per phase, and a
one-spin secret.

## v0.9.15 release notes: Bug Hunt gets a chase and a grapple

See [the full v0.9.15 notes](releases/v0.9.15.md): the DELETE wave that eats the
floor of Production, and the magnetic grapple that chains swings into launches,
dashes and bug hits.

## v0.9.14 release notes: Bug Hunt encounter chains and bonus rushes

See [the full v0.9.14 notes](releases/v0.9.14.md): dash refills on hits, optional aerial encounters, timed bonus collections, score ranks and a final boss escalation.

## v0.9.13 release notes: Bug Hunt becomes a campaign with developer powers

See [the full v0.9.13 notes](releases/v0.9.13.md). The hidden hub game grows to
three stages with a boss, double jump, dash and combos, plus four developer
power-ups: git revert, Breakpoint, sudo and Garbage Collector.

## v0.9.12 release notes: a MongoDB explorer and a hidden game

See [the full v0.9.12 notes](releases/v0.9.12.md). Database Studio gains a
Compass-style MongoDB explorer with documents, aggregations, schema, indexes and
validation; MongoDB auth now survives servers that disable SCRAM-SHA-1; and the
hub hides a small offline platformer, a0: Bug Hunt.

## v0.9.11 release notes: performance flows that explain the load

See [the full v0.9.11 notes](releases/v0.9.11.md). Flow Stress gains editable
stages, CSV data allocation, APDEX, clear workload/distribution/trend charts,
local run history and a portable `adomnia stress` CI runner with release-gate
exit codes.

## v0.9.10 release notes: AI-assisted flows and trustworthy diagnostics

See [the full v0.9.10 notes](releases/v0.9.10.md). This release completes the
Log Inspector P3 investigation workflow, turns natural-language API sequences
into executable flows with data handoffs and recovery branches, and upgrades
stress runs with scenario presets, release gates and actionable diagnostics.

## v0.9.9 release notes: flow stress tests and faster variables

See [the full v0.9.9 notes](releases/v0.9.9.md). Flows gain a concurrent stress
test with CSV/JSON/HTML exports and baseline comparison; `{{var}}` tokens get a
right-click menu to edit or copy them; flow-extracted variables are no longer
flagged unresolved.

## v0.9.8 release notes: complete local log investigations

See [the full v0.9.8 notes](releases/v0.9.8.md). This release completes the
daily Log Inspector workflow: managed and persistent sources, structured search,
custom layouts, redacted evidence, reproduction handoffs, live tails and a
disk-backed path for logs larger than RAM.

## v0.9.7 release notes: Log Inspector reliability pass

See [the full v0.9.7 notes](releases/v0.9.7.md). This is the public release for
the Log Inspector reliability pass: trace-only chains, recovered retry outcomes,
observed-window durations, `attributes.http.*` payloads, source provenance and
a Linux CI packaging fix.

## v0.9.6 release notes: Log Inspector reliability pass

Superseded by `v0.9.7` after the tag workflow failed on an external Ubuntu apt
mirror before release publication. See [the archived notes](releases/v0.9.6.md).

## v0.9.5 release notes: Log Inspector reliability pass

Superseded by `v0.9.6` after the tag workflow failed on an external Ubuntu apt
mirror before release publication. See [the archived notes](releases/v0.9.5.md).

## v0.9.4 release notes: multi-file Log Inspector

See [the full v0.9.4 notes](releases/v0.9.4.md) for cross-file correlation,
dedicated request/response payload inspection, source-file search and columns
that adapt to the fields actually present in the imported logs.

## v0.9.3 release notes: request-level Log Inspector analysis

See [the full v0.9.3 notes](releases/v0.9.3.md) for end-to-end request grouping,
deterministic timeout and HTTP classification, enterprise slog/zap fields,
sensitive-data findings and reliable overlapping import cancellation.

## v0.9.2 release notes: faster log search and nested JSON

See [the full v0.9.2 notes](releases/v0.9.2.md) for automatic field discovery
and remembered log shapes, payload-key search, regular expressions and
alternatives, the widened field aliases, recursive nested-JSON unwrapping and the
rebuilt Log Inspector empty state.

## v0.9.1 release notes: first-class Log Inspector

See [the full v0.9.1 notes](releases/v0.9.1.md) for the dedicated Power Tools
navigation and the complete local log investigation workflow.

## v0.9.0 release notes: Log Inspector

See [the full v0.9.0 notes](releases/v0.9.0.md) for supported formats,
investigation workflow, correlation, large-file behavior and verification.

## v0.8.3 release notes: reliable recording and fluid flow panels

See [the full v0.8.3 notes](releases/v0.8.3.md) for recording, response mappings,
canvas/panel controls, compatibility and verification details.

## v0.8.2 release notes: dependency refresh and sidebar follow

- Full dependency refresh across Go and the frontend, clearing every open
  Dependabot advisory. `wails/v3` and `@wailsio/runtime` moved together from
  `3.0.0-beta.7`/`3.0.0-beta.5` to `3.0.0-beta.16`, keeping the version lock the
  IPC layer depends on. gRPC, the MongoDB driver, Sarama, and amqp091-go were
  updated, along with transitive `golang.org/x/{crypto,net,text}` bumps.
- Frontend: `lucide-react` 1.38.0, `zustand` 5.0.15, `vitest` 4.1.11, and
  `rollup-plugin-visualizer` 7.1.1.
- The collection sidebar now follows the active tab: it expands the full
  collection/folder path of the selected request and scrolls the row into view,
  so a deeply nested request is no longer hidden. An active search is preserved.
- The active request row is easier to spot — accent-tinted surface, medium
  weight, and `aria-current="page"` for assistive technology.

Verified with `go build ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `go test ./...`,
`npm run build`, and `npm test` (69 files, 273 tests passing).

## v0.8.1 release notes: API Flow recording

- API Flow is a core workspace again and is available from the primary navigation.
- The REST/API Composer can record completed sends locally. `Record` captures each
  request in execution order; `Stop` opens a naming dialog and creates an editable,
  executable flow with Start, request nodes, and Stop.
- Recorded snapshots preserve request templates, request configuration, scripts,
  assertions, source request/environment metadata, and execution timing/status.
  Direct credential values are redacted; variable and Vault references remain
  replayable.
- Saved flows now use schema version 4. Existing flow data is migrated on load;
  exports can be imported again as Flow JSON or Mermaid.
- The Flow workspace supports an empty New Flow canvas, request/condition editing,
  response extraction, ordering recorded steps, replay from a selected node, and
  cancellation of a running replay.

## Release Outputs

The build workflow produces:

- `adOmnia-<version>-windows-amd64.exe`
- `adOmnia-<version>-linux-amd64`
- `adOmnia-<version>-linux-amd64.tar.gz`
- `adOmnia-<version>-macos-universal.dmg`

## Pre-Release Checklist

- [ ] `frontend/npm run build` passes.
- [ ] `go test ./...` passes.
- [ ] App launches on at least the primary development platform.
- [ ] Main workflows are smoke-tested: request send, environments, mock/proxy if changed.
- [ ] UI changes have screenshots or visual review.
- [ ] [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) has the release notes.
- [ ] [README.md](../README.md) download instructions are still accurate.

## Create a Release

Update the desktop version in `build/config.yml`, both npm manifests and their
lockfiles, and `CHANGELOG.md`. Write the public release body in
`docs/releases/<tag>.md`; the tag build publishes that file as its release notes.
Older tags without a notes file retain generated GitHub notes.

Update changelog:

```bash
# Move [Unreleased] entries to the new version section.
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: prepare release v0.1.0"
```

Create and push a tag:

```bash
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release v0.1.0"
git push origin v0.1.0
```

GitHub Actions will:

1. Run checks.
2. Build Windows, Linux, and macOS artifacts.
3. Bundle artifacts and checksums.
4. Publish a GitHub Release for tags matching `v*`.

## CI Builds Without Release

Pushes to `master`, `main`, or `develop` produce downloadable Actions artifacts but do not create a public Release.

Find them in:

**Actions -> Build Desktop Artifacts -> successful run -> Artifacts**

## Known Packaging Notes

- Windows artifacts are unsigned unless code signing is configured.
- macOS artifacts are unsigned/not notarized unless Apple signing credentials are configured.
- Linux packages are portable artifacts, not `.deb`, `.rpm`, Snap, or AppImage yet.
