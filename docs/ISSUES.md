This file contains only work that is still open. Completed items are archived in the "Recently Resolved" section below.

## Priority Guide

| Priority | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| P0 - Blocker | Stops a core workflow. |
| P1 - High | Significant daily friction. |
| P2 - Medium | Quality gap with a workaround. |
| P3 - Polish | Product still feels unfinished. |

## Open Queue

### Extension Platform v2 — planned (P1 strategic initiative)

Architecture and phased implementation plan: [EXTENSION-PLATFORM-PLAN.md](EXTENSION-PLATFORM-PLAN.md).
The target is a local-first extension system with VS Code-like contribution breadth,
a fault-isolated JavaScript/TypeScript host, declarative and isolated custom UI,
and a Pi-inspired Markdown SDK that coding agents can use to author extensions.
This plan describes future behavior; the feature catalog remains the source of truth
for what the current plugin runtime actually ships.

- [x] Target architecture, trust model, package format, Agent Skill layout, v1 compatibility, and release gates documented.
- [x] Foundation slice: strict manifest v2 contract, JSON Schema, secure package inspection, deterministic packaging, embedded/exportable Markdown SDK, Agent Skill, templates, and JSON-capable `extension init/check/pack/sdk` CLI.
- [ ] Phase 0: approve the preview contracts, complete event semantics, permission decisions, and threat-model review.
- [ ] Phase 1: finish package installation/registry, trust and grant persistence, engine compatibility, embedded TypeScript build, and Extensions UI.
- [ ] Phase 2: out-of-process extension host with activation, async APIs, cancellation, and recovery.
- [ ] Phase 3: command/menu/keybinding/settings/status contribution infrastructure.
- [ ] Phase 4: native declarative views and isolated custom webviews.
- [ ] Phase 5: adOmnia domain APIs and extension points.
- [ ] Phase 6: legacy adapter, hardening, cross-platform verification, and general availability.

## Recently Resolved (verified against code 2026-06-13)

| # | Title | Evidence |
|---|-------|----------|
| P2-09 | GraphQL schema/variables not persisted | `useGraphqlCacheStore` persists introspection; `BodyEditor.tsx` hydrates the cache on mount and re-uses the stored schema. |
| P2-11 | Keyboard shortcuts incomplete | `SettingsPanel.tsx shortcutsList` now documents 14 shortcuts (command palette, send, tab nav, url bar, search, sidebar, settings, rail switch, dev logs), up from 5. |
| P3-08 | Vault ↔ Environment bridge missing | `lib/vaultRefs.ts` resolves `vault:` references; wired into the send path (`sendRequest.ts`) and the environment editor (`EnvModal.tsx` detects/marks `vault:` refs). |
| N03 | Win95 JSON bracket depth colors collapsed | `internal/themes/extended.go` json-bracket-1/2/3 are distinct (`#000080`/`#8B0000`/`#006464`), not all `#000000`. |

## New This Cycle

### Go Studio (Go IDE) — shipped through v0.9.39, manual verification open

Implemented and covered by automated tests on Windows and Linux: projects and trust, isolated sessions and restore, gopls intelligence and refactoring, linters, Fix with AI, build/run/tests/coverage, the Delve debugger, the PTY terminal, Go Tools, Git in the editor linked to Git Studio, adOmnia integrations, Go Studio workspaces and separate project windows. Details: [GO-STUDIO.md](GO-STUDIO.md). The work queue lives in `todo-ide.md`.

Open:

- [ ] **P1 — Manual checks in the running app** (M1–M31 in `todo-ide.md`): real-project flows on Windows, Task Manager clean-up, ConPTY in the window, debugger from the UI, themes, and the quality bar compared with the approved mocks.
- [ ] **P2 — Separate windows not declared yet**: implemented and tested automatically; to be declared in the release notes after the real-window check (M31).
- [ ] **P1 — Docker Build & Run by hand** (v0.9.39): with Docker Desktop running, Build image, Build & Run and Stop on a real Dockerfile (container removed, `docker ps` clean). The automated test skips without a daemon; Make is already covered end to end.
- [ ] **P3 — macOS runtime not verified**: the package cross-builds, but nothing has run on macOS.

Residual limits (by design, stated in the product):

- Push, pull, merge, conflicts, rebase and stash stay in Git Studio; other version control systems are not supported.
- Plugins get read-only events (contract v1) and no commands.
- The API Client CodeLens resolves route prefixes only within the same file.
- Remote debugging needs identical source paths for breakpoints.
- Refactorings are limited to the code actions gopls offers.
- Fix with AI needs an AI provider enabled and verified in Settings, and sends the affected code only when the user clicks.


### Developer Context P0+P1 — implemented (branch `feat/devcontext`, 2026-09-29)

- [x] Entity router (`frontend/src/lib/entities/`), panel handoff, notice bar
- [x] Project context backend (`internal/devcontext`): go.mod, compose, .env (masked), OAS/proto/WSDL, Go routes, getenv/SQL/topics
- [x] Palette groups Project + Symbols, Tab actions
- [ ] Manual smoke in `wails3 task dev` on a real Go project (see plan Task 13 Step 5)
- Next: P2 gO code lenses + env resolver.

### Log Inspector — shipped (v0.9.0, promoted to a rail destination in v0.9.1)

Local-first log investigation studio: paste / drop / open OpenShift and application
logs (single JSON, JSON array, JSONL/NDJSON, plain and mixed text, CRI-O prefixes,
ANSI, Java exceptions, Go panics, escaped nested JSON). Format is detected from the
content, never from the extension; a malformed line is marked `RAW` without stopping
the import. Virtualized event list, field-query language (`level:error pod:pay-*
-service:noisy`), facets, time range, correlation-ID/trace-ID chronological
reconstruction with deltas, sensitive-field masking, and JSON/JSONL/text export.
Parsing runs in a Web Worker with progressive batches, cancellation and a configurable
50k–500k retention ceiling. Files: `lib/loginspector/*`, `components/loginspector/*`.
Verification: 73 dedicated tests, 354 frontend tests across 72 files, TypeScript and
production frontend build, `go build`/`go vet`/`go test ./...`.

Pending:

| Priority | Item |
|---|---|
| — | ~~`oc logs` execution~~ — done: `internal/logstream` tails local files and runs `kubectl`/`oc`/`docker logs -f` through the sidecar, with explicit context/namespace/pod/container, bounded buffer, stop/resume without duplicates, and CLI availability reported up front. |
| P2 | Live tailing — the parser is already incremental (`createLogParser`), it needs a stream-fed entry point. |
| P2 | No tests cover the worker `parse`/`progress`/`cancel` protocol; the pure parser and the main-thread fallback are covered. |
| P3 | `raw` keeps a per-event copy of the source line, the dominant memory cost at 100k events; an offset into the original text would remove it. |
| P3 | `.gz` / `.zip` inputs must be extracted manually before import. |

### Flows — scoped variables and stress test (2026-09-11)

Fixed: a `{{var}}` pasted into a step body was flagged unresolved (red) although the
runner resolved it, because request editors only looked at the active environment.
Editors inside a flow step now also see variables extracted by other steps and the last
run's values (`lib/flowScopeVars.ts`).

New: flow **Stress test** dock (`lib/flowStress.ts`, `lib/flowStressStats.ts`,
`lib/flowStressExport.ts`, `components/flows/FlowStressPanel.tsx`). Up to 200 local
virtual users, iterations/duration or editable stages, CSV/JSON/JUnit/HTML exports,
APDEX, active-user/distribution/trend charts, persisted history and baseline
comparison. Portable plans run headlessly through `adomnia stress` with CI exit
codes and dataset/environment injection.

Desktop verification (production executable driven over CDP): Mock Commerce demo,
10 VU × 30 s with 2 s ramp-up — 3385 requests, 112.8 req/s, 0 errors, 843 iterations,
live KPIs and per-step table; baseline Δ p95 and throughput change; light and dark
themes; right-click Edit / Copy value / Copy reference on body and URL variables.

| Priority | Item |
|---|---|
| P3 | Export files were not opened from the native save dialog during the desktop pass; builders are covered by unit tests. |
| P3 | Scoped variables ignore graph order: a step also sees variables produced by later steps. |
| P3 | Multi-machine distributed load still needs an authenticated worker protocol; the desktop and headless engines intentionally remain local generators. |

### Flows — recording and demo usability (2026-09-08)

Fixed `unknown storage bucket "flows"` on recording/save. Recordings infer exact,
unambiguous JSON response-to-request mappings, including bearer tokens and typed JSON
bodies, and retain mappings through save/load. Runtime transport errors appear in the
timeline; Stop on failure prevents later linear steps from running. The canvas now has
contrasting arrows, branch-preserving arrangement, pan/zoom/fit controls and adjustable
panels. Saved graph positions are retained when the flow is reopened.

September 9 usability update: compact flow switcher and node rows, cursor-anchored
zoom, frame-scheduled free dragging (Shift snaps), and independent panel visibility.
Inspector, timeline, Mermaid import and AI panels share float/dock, resize, maximize
and close controls. Closing the inspector preserves selection; execution highlights
do not reopen closed panels. The focus toggle temporarily hides panels.
Desktop verification also covered panel close/reopen, floating drag, corner resize
and workspace maximization in the production executable.

Verification: 30 targeted frontend tests, TypeScript and production frontend build,
`go build ./...` and `go test ./...`. Desktop checks completed: four-API mock demo,
REC login → order with the inferred `user.id` mapping, save/open, and successful replay
(HTTP 200/201). The development CLI was run from `build/` because `root_path: ..`
in `build/config.yml` resolves against its working directory.

### PDF Editor — shipped (branch `feat/pdf-editor`)
View + edit PDFs (free text, highlight, shapes, ink, AcroForm fill, visible signature),
re-editable project persistence (bbolt `pdfprojects`), flattened export. Pending: manual
`wails3 task dev` smoke of the full open→annotate→export→reopen loop. Spec:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-13-pdf-editor-design.md`.

### API Docs / Swagger viewer — shipped (branch `feat/pdf-editor`)
Dedicated read-only OpenAPI 3 / Swagger 2.0 reference (rail: API Core → Design),
token-native (no external Swagger-UI/Redoc framework). Sources: generate from a
collection, fetch from URL via the Go request engine, or paste/open a JSON/YAML file.
Grouped by tag with params, request/response schemas (recursive `$ref` resolution),
examples, and an operation filter. v1 is read-only ("Try it" deferred). Files:
`lib/apidocs/parseSpec.ts`, `components/apidocs/*`. Pending: manual `wails3 task dev` smoke.
