# Architecture

adOmnia is a local-first desktop developer toolbox built with Wails 3.

## Runtime Shape

```text
React/TypeScript frontend
        |
Wails generated bindings
        |
Go backend services
        |
local files, bbolt, network clients, subprocesses
```

## Frontend

Location: `frontend/`

- React 19 and TypeScript.
- Vite build pipeline.
- Zustand stores for shared UI state.
- Wails 3 generated bindings under `frontend/bindings/` (`frontend/src/wailsjs/` is only a compatibility shim).
- Dense desktop UI with local design tokens and utility classes.

Key areas:

- `frontend/src/components/` for panels and layout.
- `frontend/src/lib/` for API wrappers, request execution, parsers, and helpers.
- `frontend/src/stores/` for app state.

Startup navigation is split by the local UI-session memento. The lightweight
`MainAreaRouter` stays in the entry bundle; the request workspace is a separate
chunk, preloaded before React when the restored rail is `collections` and left
unrequested for Home or secondary panels. Its Suspense fallback reuses the
quiet hydration shell to preserve layout stability.

## Backend

Location: the repository root is a thin Wails binding layer (`main.go`, `app.go`, `*_bindings.go`); feature logic lives in `internal/<domain>/`.

The Go backend owns local system integrations:

- HTTP execution, proxy, mock server, record/replay.
- Browser debugging through Chrome DevTools Protocol.
- Kafka and broker integrations.
- gRPC, WebSocket, SSE, load testing.
- Database tooling.
- Docker Lab generation.
- Themes, plugins, templates, vault, storage.

Wails exposes backend methods to the frontend through generated bindings.

### Extension Platform v2 preview

The executable, authenticated extension-host subprocess, package registry, permission broker,
contribution surfaces, domain slices, and authoring SDK live in `internal/extensions` and
`sdk/extensions`. The headless `adomnia extension` command can scaffold, compile, test,
strictly validate, deterministically package, install, inspect, and export the embedded
Markdown SDK. The v2 runtime remains separate from `internal/plugins`; unchanged v1 packages
execute through the explicit compatibility adapter. Remaining GA gates are tracked in
`docs/EXTENSION-PLATFORM-PLAN.md`.

## Storage

adOmnia uses local storage only:

- bbolt for durable app data.
- localStorage for selected frontend state.
- `.adomnia` workspace files for portable exports.
- Local filesystem for templates, skins, plugins, and artifacts.

Storage changes should preserve backward compatibility. The canonical database is
`<application-data>/adomnia.db`. Builds that previously created
`<application-data>/adomnia/adomnia.db` are migrated only after obtaining an exclusive bbolt
lock; desktop and extension CLI use the same migration path, and startup chrome detection can
read either location before migration.

Collection workspaces use an additive bbolt schema:

- `collections/index-v3` stores the active workspace id and lightweight workspace metadata.
- `collections/workspace:<id>` stores one collection tree per workspace; only the active shard is read during bootstrap and other shards load on first access.
- `collections/all` remains a complete version-2 snapshot. Migration to v3 never removes it, and every v3 write rebuilds it atomically for downgrade, snapshot, and storage-inspector compatibility.

If the v3 index or active shard is invalid, startup falls back to `collections/all`. Migration and writes are local, idempotent, and do not change the portable `.adomnia` format.

The Wails startup bootstrap has two compatible envelopes. Version 2 embeds the
persisted JSON as structured values and reports per-block byte sizes; version 1
remains available as a string-based fallback for existing builds and corrupted
or unsupported v2 responses.

## Go Studio

Go Studio is the integrated Go IDE. User-facing behaviour, trust rules and storage details are in [GO-STUDIO.md](GO-STUDIO.md).

**Backend.** `internal/goide` holds a single `Service`, registered through `goide_bindings.go` and shared by every window. It is composed of managers, each owning one kind of resource:

| Manager | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `WorkspaceManager`, `studioWorkspaceRegistry` | Sessions (one per open project), trust state, Go Studio workspaces |
| `DocumentManager`, `WatchManager`, `LocalHistory`, `RecoveryManager` | Documents confined to the project root, atomic saves, file watching, local history, unsaved-buffer recovery |
| `ToolchainManager`, `ToolchainInstaller` | Go SDK detection, official installs, per-session environment |
| `LSPManager` (`internal/goide/lsp`) | One gopls process per trusted session, JSON-RPC, document sync, features and diagnostics |
| `ProcessManager` | Build, run, tests, Go Tools and dependency commands; output events, stdin, process-tree stop |
| `TerminalManager` | PTY shells (ConPTY on Windows) per session |
| `DebugManager` (`internal/goide/dap`) | Delve over DAP: launch, attach, remote |
| `TestManager`, `RunConfigManager` | Structured test runs and coverage; saved run configurations |
| `windowRegistry` | Which window may edit each session |

`internal/goidewindow` creates the native separate windows (same pattern as `internal/swaggerwindow`), and `internal/git` provides the Git operations reused by the editor VCS features.

**Lifecycle.** Opening a project creates a session in the *opened* state; nothing is started. Trusting it allows gopls, linters, processes, terminals and debugging for that session. Every process is owned by a manager and tied to its session: closing the session, revoking trust or quitting the app stops the whole process tree, and `Service.Shutdown` releases everything in order. `restore()` loads the persisted state lazily on the first call and retries after transient errors.

**Events.** The backend reports progress through `goide:event` envelopes (`sessionId`, `resourceId`, sequence, payload) broadcast to every window: `run.*`, `terminal.*`, `lsp.*`, `debug.*`, `files.changed`, `session.*`. Each frontend store routes them by session and resource. Close confirmation uses `goide:close-requested` for the main window and `goide:window-close-requested` for separate windows.

**Frontend.** Zustand stores under `frontend/src/stores/goide*.ts` hold UI state per session (documents, runs, LSP, VCS, tests, debug, workspaces, windows). Components live in `frontend/src/components/goide/`, and Monaco language features are registered once in `goStudioLanguageFeatures.ts`. The whole of Go Studio is lazy-loaded, and the startup budget check keeps it out of the initial bundle.

**Windows.** The backend stays single. A separate window hosts its own frontend, with its own unsaved buffers, so each session has exactly one editing window. The registry refuses a second one, `CloseSession` refuses a session owned elsewhere, and the window that gives up a project stops persisting its view.

**Storage.** Go Studio uses the bbolt `goide` bucket: `state` (schema 4, migrated in memory from older versions), `recovery` and `localHistory`. Managed SDKs and tools live under the adOmnia data folder.

## Security Model

- No telemetry.
- No hidden cloud sync.
- Network calls happen only from explicit user workflows.
- Vault entries are encrypted locally.
- Proxy, mock, Docker, browser, and script features are powerful local tools and should be treated carefully.
- Go Studio runs project code and tools only after the project is explicitly trusted, and confines file access to the project root.

## Distribution

GitHub Actions builds platform artifacts:

- Windows `.exe`
- Linux executable and `.tar.gz`
- macOS universal `.dmg`

See [docs/BUILD.md](BUILD.md) and [docs/RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md).
