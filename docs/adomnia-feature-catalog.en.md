# adOmnia — Feature Catalog

**adOmnia** is a local-first desktop API Development Toolbox built with Go (Wails 3) + React 19 (TypeScript), with an integrated Go IDE (Go Studio).  
All features are offline-first: no account, no telemetry, and no data sent outside the machine.

## MACRO-CATEGORY INDEX

### Navigation interactions (v0.9.25)

- Single-click requests open a replaceable preview; double-click, editing, pinning or sending keeps the tab. F2/context menu renames tree items.
- Ctrl/Cmd-click toggles requests, Shift-click selects a visible range. Drag selected requests together in visual order, with a labelled ghost and before/after/inside indicators. Invalid nested moves are rejected.
- Hover folders for 550 ms to expand; drag near tree edges to scroll. Drop requests on the tab strip to open them at that position, or onto an empty workspace to open them.
- Tree moves show an Undo action. Undo is refused if the affected collections have subsequently changed, so newer edits are never overwritten.
- Returning to the API panel preserves tree expansion, query, focus and scroll per workspace for the current app session. Existing tab view-state preservation remains in place.
- Rail icons directly open their category's last-used visible tool; the small arrow, right-click or ArrowRight opens the complete category menu. Since v0.9.26, hovering for 220 ms also opens it; it stays open after pointer exit or item selection until closed with X/Escape, an outside click or another category. Icons have a plain background and a larger side marker; Send/Record use flat skin-token colors.
- Compatibility: tab `preview` is optional (old tabs remain permanent); no workspace schema migration. `adomnia.railQuick.v1` is an optional localStorage preference, ignored safely if malformed; tree navigation state stays in memory. No network services or telemetry added.

---

### A5. Flows (Multi-Step Workflow)

| # | Feature | Description |
|---|-------------|-------------|
| A5.1 | **Mermaid Input** | Paste or import a Mermaid diagram as the source of truth; users are not forced to draw a graph manually. |
| A5.2 | **Automatic Generation** | Converts the diagram into a mostly read-only visual API flow with steps, conditions, branches, and execution order. |
| A5.3 | **API Catalog Binding** | Automatically matches API steps to real local collection/API catalog requests, with a light override when needed. |
| A5.4 | **Response Conditions** | Decision nodes evaluate status, headers, JSON body paths, variables, or expressions from real API responses. |
| A5.5 | **End-to-End Execution** | The runner follows the Mermaid sequence and chooses success/error/true/false branches. |
| A5.6 | **Runtime Status** | Each step shows pending, running, success, failed, or skipped with duration, HTTP status, and readable messages. |
| A5.7 | **Environment Variables** | Reuses the existing request engine, so `{{var}}`, auth, cookies, scripts, and assertions stay compatible. |
| A5.8 | **Side Inspector** | Shows request mapping, condition configuration, and the local request catalog. |
| A5.9 | **Run Log** | Shows execution order, request/response status, duration, assertions, and readable errors. |
| A5.10 | **Flow Validation** | Flags empty Mermaid, missing request URLs, incomplete conditions, and missing branches. |
| A5.11 | **Save / Load Flow** | Persists version 4 flow definitions in local bbolt storage, retaining edited positions and mappings. Older graphs and localStorage recordings are loaded without discarding their content. |
| A5.12 | **Export Flow JSON** | Exports the flow definition as JSON with Mermaid, nodes, edges, config, and settings. |
| A5.13 | **Export Markdown Report** | Exports the last run result as a Markdown report. |
| A5.14 | **Record API Calls** | Record → send API requests → Stop → Create Flow opens an editable sequence. Exact, unambiguous JSON response values copied to later bodies, parameters or bearer auth become response extractions and variable references. Review mappings before replay; ambiguous values stay literal. Response bodies remain session-only. |
| A5.15 | **Canvas Controls** | Compact nodes with readable directional arrows, arrangement preserving branches, smooth drag/pan, cursor-anchored Ctrl-scroll zoom, F to fit and Shift-drag grid snapping. Inspector, timeline, Mermaid import and AI panels can close, float, resize and maximize; toolbar buttons reopen inspector/timeline and toggle canvas focus. Saved flows are available from the header switcher. |
| A5.16 | **Flow-Scoped Variables** | Inside a step's request editor, `{{var}}` references extracted by other steps (or produced by the last run) are shown as defined instead of unresolved, with the producing step or last value in the tooltip. Nothing is copied into the environment. |
| A5.17 | **Stress Test** | The **Stress** dock runs the whole flow with up to 200 isolated local virtual users. Smoke/load/spike/soak presets join custom iterations/duration and editable staged workloads with ramp, target VUs and measured warm-up/cooldown phases. Results include overall and per-step p50/p90/p95/p99, throughput/data rate, APDEX, status and normalized error groups, explicit p95/error/RPS/APDEX release gates, deterministic bottleneck/tail/regression guidance, baseline comparison, and CSV/JSON/JUnit/HTML evidence. |
| A5.18 | **AI Flow Architect** | Converts natural-language orchestration into an editable Flow using the existing AI Engine and local API catalog. It explicitly maps earlier response JSONPaths into named `{{variables}}` consumed by later URLs, headers, query or bodies; transport/timeout/HTTP/assertion failures become `error` recovery branches while successful calls follow `success`. Preview exposes calls, data handoffs, recovery paths, missing data and destructive operations before import. |
| A5.19 | **Stress Datasets** | A local CSV dataset supplies variables on every flow iteration with sequential, per-VU or pseudo-random row allocation. `__vu`, `__iteration`, `__timestamp` and `__uuid` are always available and dataset values remain outside exported CI plans. |
| A5.20 | **Performance Charts & History** | Independent traffic/error axes, actual active-VU timeline, per-step percentile bars, latency distribution, SLO/baseline markers and a persisted 12-run p95/RPS trend remain readable in resized panels and offline HTML reports. |
| A5.21 | **Headless Flow Stress** | **CI plan** exports a portable graph/workload file. `adomnia stress` executes it without the UI with response data extraction, retries, success/error branches, scripts, assertions, cookies, staged load, CSV/env injection, CLI/JSON/JUnit reporters and exit code 1 when requests or release gates fail. |

Storage compatibility: the `flows` bucket is created automatically when opening existing databases. Existing v3/v4 definitions and the `adomnia.flows.v1` fallback are retained; no destructive migration is required. Recorded mappings use the existing extraction schema. JSON body substitutions escape strings and preserve unquoted numeric/object values.

Existing `{{variable}}` references are also linked when their current environment value uniquely matches a previous recorded response field. This lets replay refresh the variable instead of reusing an old ID. Environment values are used only for matching and are not added to saved flow metadata.

| A8.2 | **Visual Canvas** | Vertical card stack with an "Add block" dropdown, up/down reorder, and per-card delete — no scripting required. |
| A8.3 | **Sequential Runner** | "Run Test" executes blocks in order; each card shows running → pass/fail with a message. Request responses feed subsequent asserts; SetVar/extracted variables flow to later blocks. |
| A8.4 | **Export to Flow** | Converts a visual test into a Flow graph definition (request → request node with extractions, assert → condition node, setvar → extract node) and appends it to the Flows store. |
| A8.5 | **Persistence** | Tests stored locally in `adomnia.visualTests`; survive reloads. |
